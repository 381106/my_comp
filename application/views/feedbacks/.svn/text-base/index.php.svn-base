                    Sergey did a great job on this project and rescued this project from failure. He was committed, knowledgable and always available to get things done. I would be happy to recommend him to anyone looking for an independent ace developer.<br>

                    Sergey professionally delivered the agreed work and when faced with technical difficulties swiftly found an alternative method to get the needed functionality. I enjoyed working with him and will be pleased to hire him again in the near future.<br>

                    Sergey is excellent to work with.
                    He clearly understands instructions and requirements and is able to suggest improvements where necessary.<br>
                    His time management is good and puts in the effort to maximize his availability where time zones are a factor.<br>
                    Good skills, good work ethic and another excellent job.<br>

                    Sergey is a committed skilled provider - I will re-hire him for this specific project again once it's budget gets re-opened. Meanwhile I have Sergey hired to work on a different project/assignment.<br>
                    Thanks for your dedication, Sergey.<br>
