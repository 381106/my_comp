The second generation RAV4 went on sale in the middle of 2000, and came in base Edge and upmarket Cruiser models 
(model designations may vary according to market), in both 3- and 5-door configurations. The main differentiation between 
the two models was in appearance. Edge models came with unpainted grey bumpers and side cladding, mirrors, and door handles, 
and featured steel rims. Cruiser models gained body-coloured (painted) bumpers and moldings, mirrors, and door handles, alloy 
wheels, and ABS brakes. All models came equipped with a brand-new 2.0 litre 4-cylinder engine featuring VVT (variable valve timing), 
resulting in improved power and torque, as well as fuel consumption. Permanent all-wheel-drive was a feature. Options were ABS brakes 
(on the Edge), and air conditioning (on all models).
